# neovim.settings
My up-to-date neovim settings. Ideally syncronized throughout all machines I am using.

To put this into a new machine, simply 'git clone git@github.com:wefeng97/neovim.settings.git' and replace the nvim folder by neovim.settings folder. Do backup the original folder before replacing.

An 'eval `ssh-agent -s` && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_GitHub' could be necessary. 

Remember to push all the changes, and pull in other machines afterwards.
