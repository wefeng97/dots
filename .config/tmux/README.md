My personal settings for tmux. Ideally all the tmux settings are synchronized with git.

This repo has several git public repos. Should be careful if you were at those folders.

To update the tmux settings, go into the master folder at tmux mode and execute 'tmux source tmux.conf'.

To install a new plugin for tmux, type in the dedicated plugin into tmux.conf and at tmux mode, enter <prefix> + I.
